            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Where, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning you ſhall finde certaine briefe notes neceſſarie to be obſerued of the Breeder.

The fourth Booke intreateth of the Sadlers office, how he ſhould make his ſaddle, and what kinde of ſaddle is beſt, both for ſeruice and trauell: And alſo how euerie ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dior may carrie both his headpeece, and piſtoll, in ſuch ſort as it ſhall not trouble him any more than if he had nothing at al at his ſaddle: Alſo it teacheth how to make your headſtall, to ſerue in ſteede of a collar, when you trauell anie iourney, or that you are in ſeruice, a thing verie neceſſarie to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of al ſouldiers: It teacheth you alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt as touching your manger, you may make it of thrée faſhions: the firſt is, as we commonly vſe them in <hi>England,</hi> which ſerueth to no other vſe, but for them to eate their prouender in, and the haie which they ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or let fall when they eate out of the racke: the ſecond faſhion ſerueth both for prouender and forrage, for that it is made higher, déeper, and wider by a great deale than our common manger is, and alſo it is made with ſtaues or laths, nailed on the bottome, in ſuch ſorte, that it may holde the forage, and let the duſt fall through: and alſo you may make a manger for euerie couple of horſes of thrée foote long, with a partition in the middle thereof placed iuſt betwixt your horſes, ſo as they may bothe reach their prouender in the ſame, and let the partition thereof ſtand iuſt with the end of the barre that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your horſes, ſo as the one halfe may be in the one roome, and the other halfe in the other. Thus ſhal your horſe haue place inough for his forrage, without being letted with the manger: note herewith, that all ſuche mangers as theſe be, muſt haue ſtaues made faſte at the one ende in the wall, or vppon the ſide of the manger nexte to the wall, and at the other ende
<pb facs="tcp:5378:62"/> you muſt make them faſt to the outſide of the manger, and let ſuch ſtaues be placed a foot and an halfe one from an other, to the end that your horſe may eaſily reach his forrage, and yet not be able to caſt it out of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor into his fellowes roome with his head. The third waie is to make it foure times as bigge as our common mangers are, ſo that the horſe can do no more than reach eaſilie to the bottome, and this manger muſt be all plankes, as well in the bottome as on the ſides, that the horſe may both eate his prouender and forrage therein. This manger haue I often made in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> being in the campe, where I had no ſtables, but was forced to make my horſes roomes in a barne or great houſe, in this ſort: You muſt firſt at the one ende of the houſe or barne, where you meane that your manger ſhall ſtand, digge a pitte in the ground thrée foot and an halfe déepe, let it be fiue foote from the wall or end of the houſe, where your horſe muſt ſtand, with his right or left ſide to it, and let the pitts be from the wall that ſhall be before your horſes head, ſo as your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be two foote and an halfe wide in the bottome, and thrée foote wide in the toppe, then ſhall you put a poſt therein of ſuch height as you will haue your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then may you make an other pit in the corner of the foreſaid wall, and hauing nailed a ſtrong planke at both endes to the foreſaid poſtes, then may you make two holes in the wall, into the which you ſhall putte two ſmall péeces of timber, and naile them at the other endes faſt to the two foreſaide poſtes, a foote beneath the neather edge of your plancke, then may you ſet a trough therevppon for the horſe both to eate his forrage and prouender in: then may you ſet an other poſt in the ground behind your horſe to hang your barre vpon, and the other ende thereof to your firſt poſt: in this ſorte may you make all the reſt of your roomes, with manger
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5378:62"/> and barre betwixt your horſes, very commodiouſly and quickly. And as touching your planckes, it is a thing not vſed beyond ſeas, and yet haue I kepte my horſes there as ſounde as euer I did in <hi>England</hi> vppon the planckes.</p>

For if you ſhould let them ſtand on the grounde, it will in ſhort time become all mire: and if you paue your ſtable, it will be verie colde, and alſo weare your horſes ſhooes, breake them and his hoofes, much more than vpon the planckes, and your horſes alſo wil ſpend twice as much litter as vpon the plancks.</p>

                  <p>As touching that thou ſaieſt the grounde will be all mire, thou art deceiued: for thou muſt firſt digge awaie the earth two or thrée foote déepe, and fill in vnder your horſes, grauel, ſand, and ſtones, if they may be had, but if thou canſt haue nothing but ſtones, then muſt thou breake them with great hammers, and couer them with horſe dung and litter vppon it for the ſpace of tenne or twelue daies, that your ſtones may be well faſtened with the dung and treading of your horſe, and at the twelue daies end, hauing taken away your dung, you ſhall ſée your grauel or ſtones ſo hard as a rocke: but you muſt note by the waie, that you leaue a gutter right vnder your horſes bellies cleane through your ſtable a foote and an halfe déepe, and ſo wide as the breadth of the planck that you can get to couer the ſame fitly, and ſée that you place that plancke ſomewhat lower than the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is one of the beſt faſhions that euer
<pb facs="tcp:5378:63"/> I tried or ſaw in any place where ſoeuer I haue trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And whereas thou ſaieſt ſtones weare thy horſes ſhooes, breakes them and their hoofes, waſtes more litter, and is more cold, I could neuer find my horſe to like one whit worſe on the ſtones than on the plancks, although ſomething it weare their ſhooes more than plancks, and that he may alſo breake his hoof or ſhooe ſomthing more than vpon the plancks, &amp; I grant alſo it wil waſte ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the more litter, yet if thou wouldeſt well conſider how many good horſes are hurt and miſchiefed in their legs, ſhoulders, and ſmall of their backs, by dangerous ſlipping, ſliding, falling, and hanging their legs therein, thou wouldſt grant the floore made as before, and paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ten times better than the plancks, yea, and they are made and maintained with leſſe charges by an halfe than the planckes. But you muſt note that when you paue your ſtable, that you leaue a gutter through your horſes roomes couered with a plancke, as before, &amp; take héed that whether you plancke your ſtable, or paue, or make the floore with ſand or grauell, that you make it not aboue 4. or 5. inches higher before than behinde: for by making it verie high before your horſe, he ſhall ſtand vneaſily, and if you ſhall mooue him neuer ſo little in the ſtable, he will be readie to fall, beſides that, his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when he doth lie will all fall behinde him: and alſo if he chance to tumble or wallow himſelfe in his roome, you ſhall ſée him ſettle ſo farre backward that he cannot riſe, for that his hinder legs wil be clean without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſts of his roome, &amp; he hangs ſo ſhort by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neck that it is not poſſible for hun to riſe til you looſe his collar, which is a thing verie dangerous, for vpon ſuch planckes you may ſoone marre any horſe.</p>

               <p>THis commeth of abundaunce of corrupt bloud, or by ſtanding with other horſes that hath the lyke diſeaſe, for it is verie infectious. The ſignes to knowe it be theſe: It beginneth alwayes vppon a veine, and it breaketh ſorth into many little knottes or braunches, which wil breake out and run with matter verie filthie to beholde. The cure: Let him bloud the firſt daie on one ſide of his necke, and the ſeconde or third daie on the other ſide. After you haue let him bloud the firſt time, cut a ſlit in his forehead of an inch long, foure inches beneath the rootes of the haire of his fore toppe, ſo that the ſlit may bée iuſt in the middle of his forehead, that béeing done, with a Cornet, raſe al the ſkinne from the horſes forehead euen vppe to his foretoppe, then ſhall you put therin a docke roote of two or thrée inches long, béeing firſt made cleane and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bruſed with a hammer or cudgell, and let it remaine in his head a moneth, and ſée that you thruſt out the matter once a daie, and take héede you thruſt not out the roote, but if ſo be it will not tarrie in, then may you with a ſhoomakers thréed thruſt through both ſides of the ſlit, tie it ſo faſt that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote cannot fal out, or els you may make faſt the roote by putting the foreſaid ſhooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers end, through the ſkin of his forehead, &amp; through the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5378:84"/> middle of the roote an inch aboue the ſlitte, which being tied faſt, will holde the roote that it can not fall out, and it is a much better waie than the other, for that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may haue frée iſſue: you ſhall alſo burne with a hote yron round about al the ſore places: then ſhal you burne all the foreſaide buttons, with a blunt yron of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your little finger, ſo déepe vntill you ſée ſée the white matter ſpring out about the point of your yron: that being done, ſharpe the point of the foreſaid yron and crooke it a little an inch from the point, ſo that when you thruſt it through the horſes ſkinne, the point may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies turne outward from the fleſh: then ſhall you take holde of the ſkinne with a paire of pinſors, and pull it cleane from the fleſh, then paſſe the yron through, ſo that the holes made with the yron may be foure or fiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches one from an other: that being done, annoint al the burnt places with ſope, and dreſſe him no more for the ſpace of foure or fiue daies: In which time, you muſt prepare a good quantitie of ſtrong piſſe; with the which you muſt waſh him euerie daie, the piſſe being firſt made ſcalding hote, ſée that you rubbe him well vntill it be readie to bléede, then hauing dried all the ſore places, throwe on the powder of vnſlaked lime, or burnt allum, which will heale much better than lime. And if you ſée that in anie of the ſores, through negligent dreſſing, there riſeth proude fleſh ſo high that you can not correct it ſufficiently with the foreſaide powder, then may you burn anie ſuch place ſo ſore or ſorer as you did at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, and dreſſe it as before, and take héed that you giue your horſe nothing but ſtrawe to eate, vntil he be whole, and let him haue ſo little reſt as may be: for letting him bloud, then diet and reaſonable exerciſe with the docke roote in his forehead, is ſufficient to heale anie horſe, if you dreſſe him in this ſort at the firſt beginning of his diſeaſe, without purging or burning him, but if it be
<pb facs="tcp:5378:85"/> olde you muſt both purge and burne him, as hath béene before taught: I haue founde ſome horſes that haue had this diſeaſe in one of their legges, and by euill dreſſing and long delaying, the humours haue had ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that when I haue healed his legge, as is before taught, in one place, it hath broken out in an other, which horſe I haue cured in this ſorte, I haue firſt cut a ſlit of an inch long through the ſkinne of his bellie. vnder the middle thereof, and raſed the ſkinne round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a cornet from the fleſh ſo farre as I coulde reach with the ſame. Then haue I put in a roll of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a hole in the middle: And in like manner haue I made an iſſue vnder the point of the ſhoulder of the gréeued legge, which two iſſues with that on his forehead, I haue let runne continually til ſuch time as he was healed: preſently after that I had made the two laſt iſſues, I haue burned all his legge with long ſtrikes from his bodie, euen downe to the houfes, diſtant no more one from an other, but the breadth of an inch: and take héede that your yrou, when you will burne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie horſe in this ſorte be not vpon the edge no thicker than the breadth of a ſtrawe: and note, that in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning anie horſe, that you beginne alwaies aboue, and drawe your hand downeward with the haire, and that you burne him ſo déepe that you ſée the ſkinne looke browne.

But then I vndertooke my ſelfe to cure him, with no ſmall enuie of all the dogge leaches of <hi>Paris,</hi> who often times did ſaie behinde my backe, that when I hadde healed that horſe, they would looſe their heades: But GOD to whome all glorie is due, ſo bleſſed me, that I healed him within the ſpace of ſixe moneths, which thing I did greately eſtéeme for my credites ſake: yea, I was ſo carefull I woulde neuer let anie man dreſſe him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I had two farriers at my commaundement, who woulde verie willingly haue dreſſed him, if I woulde: but my horſe béeing cured perfectly of this diſeaſe, the dogge leaches beganne to triumph, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: though you haue cured him yet you can not make his legge ſo ſmall as it was, but I alſo ſtopped their mouthes, for I made his legge ſo ſmall as euer it was, in this ſorte héere following: I laide a plaiſter vppon his legge made of wine Lées, and wheate flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and rolled it with a long roll, of thrée fingers broade, of eight or tenne foote long, made of ſoft Cotten: In this ſorte did I make his legge ſmall in the ſpace of foure moneths. During this cure I neuer failed my iourney, and trauelled the foreſaide horſe at my pleaſure without anie trouble or hinderaunce, ſaue that I made his groome to carrie his roll and plaiſter in a little ſacke made for that purpoſe, and alſo an oxe blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der full of wine Lees, with the which I dreſſed him preſently as ſoone as I came to my lodging, and ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it awaie the next morning, I made the kéeper to rub his leg clean: with this medicine haue I healed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers horſes that haue had great legs, but two of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt notableſt that euer I cured in <hi>England</hi> were, the one at M. <hi>Barnard Drakes</hi> in <hi>Deuon</hi> ſhire.
